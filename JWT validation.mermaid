    Server->>Server: Compute SHA-256 hash of (BASE64URL_ENCODED_HEADER + "." + BASE64URL_ENCODED_PAYLOAD)
    Server->>Server: Sign hash using RSA with Private Key -> Signature
    Server->>Client: Send JWT (Header.Payload.Signature) to Client
    Client->>Client: Split JWT: Header, Payload, Signature
    Client->>Client: Decode Header to get "alg" and "kid"
    Client->>IdP: Fetch public key for "kid" from JWKS endpoint
    IdP-->>Client: Return public key
    Client->>Client: Compute SHA-256 hash of received (BASE64URL_ENCODED_HEADER + "." + BASE64URL_ENCODED_PAYLOAD)
    Client->>Client: Use public key to decrypt JWT Signature -> Decrypted Hash
    Client->>Client: Compare computed hash with Decrypted Hash
    Client->>Client: If matching, JWT is validated

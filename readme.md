# OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Flows

This repository is dedicated to providing a clear and concise understanding of the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authentication and authorization flows. It includes a series of diagrams and accompanying explanations to help developers and architects grasp the concepts and steps involved in these protocols.

## Introduction

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization. It focuses on client developer simplicity while providing specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
